# Exercises {-}

Application exercises will be posted and completed in Posit Cloud. If the class schedule indicates that we worked on a particular exercise, you can find it posted as an "assignment" in the class Posit Cloud workspace. If you miss class, I will not check whether you complete these, but they are a good place to start to catch up on what you missed.

<i class="fa fa-github"></i> Solutions, if applicable, will be available to view in the [exercises repo](https://github.com/ENST222/exercises).
