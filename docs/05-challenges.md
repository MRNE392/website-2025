# Challenges {-}

To complete the data challenges, I will make an individual GitHub repo for each student. You'll clone the repo into your Posit Cloud RStudio workspace, complete the challenge, and push your work back to GitHub. I will also post links to the challenge docs here for your reference. 

<i class="fa fa-github"></i> Solutions will be available in the [challenges repo](https://github.com/ENST222/challenges)
