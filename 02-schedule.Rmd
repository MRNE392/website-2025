# Schedule {-}

The table below is a comprehensive guide to the semester. The `topics and materials` column has links to learning objectives and a lesson plan and materials used in class each day. `assessments` outlines the quiz schedule and assignment due dates. This column also links to pages containing details about assignment guidelines/specifications. The `notes` column mostly indicates how to prepare for labs. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(magrittr)
library(kableExtra)
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
options(kableExtra.html.bsTable = T)
kable(readxl::read_xlsx("schedule.xlsx")) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 12,
                            fixed_thead = T,
                            bootstrap_options = "hover")
```
