# Welcome {-}

This is the homepage for ENST/MRNE 392 Field Research Methods taught by Dr. Cassie Gurbisz in Fall 2025 at St. Mary's College of Maryland. All course materials will be posted on this site, accessible through the [Schedule](https://MRNE392.github.io/website-2025/schedule.html) page and the navigation bar on the left.

This website was built with the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown) R package with help from [rstudio4edu](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/).
